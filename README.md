# What is VRI?
[OpenVRI](https://github.com/VRI/OpenVRI) is an open-source project that will provide a framework for creating a playground for your research purposes. We are going to introduce OpenVRI by the end of the March. IVRI is an online competition that will use OpenVRI's pre-release version.
